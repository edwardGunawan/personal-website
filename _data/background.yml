  I'm a recent graduate of <a href="http://ucsd.edu/" target="_blank" class="background-link" style="color:black"><strong>UC San Diego</strong></a>. After taking my first internship at
  <a href="http://schen.ucsd.edu/lab/" class="background-link" target="_blank" style="color:black"><strong>Chen-lab Bionano Material</strong></a>,
  I realized the importance of good design and clean code.
  From then, I had the privilege of being a part of the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/us-en/" target="_blank" class="background-link" style="color:black"> <strong>IBM's</strong></a> three-month co-op program
  and <a href="https://www.macys.com/" class="background-link" target="_blank" style="color:black"><strong>Macy's</strong></a> internship program as a mobile-web developer.

    As a software engineer, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and design.
  My background has helped me in designing foolproof user-experiences.
  Moving from Indonesia to China at the age of 12 and migrating to the United States at the age of 16 with my brother has helped me conduct observations through different perspectives and helped me to implement applications in a user-centric manner.
  My goal is to build applications that are not only scalable and efficient, but also provide an adaptable user-experience.

  <strong>When I'm not working</strong>, I'm traveling, reading books, and
  cooking unique and interesting dishes.
