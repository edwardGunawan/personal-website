  I'm a 2018 recent graduate at <a href="http://ucsd.edu/" target="_blank" style="color:black"><strong>UC San Diego</strong></a>.
  After taking my first internship, <a href="http://schen.ucsd.edu/lab/" target="_blank" style="color:black"><strong>Chen-lab Bio nano Material</strong></a>, I realized the importance of good design and clean-code.
  From then, I have the priviledge to be apart of the three-month co-op program <a href="https://www.ibm.com/us-en/" target="_blank" style="color:black"> <strong> IBM </strong>,
  and mobile-web developer at <a href="https://www.macys.com/" target="_blank" style="color:black"><strong> Macy's Tech </strong> </a>.

  As a front-end engineer, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineer and design.
  My background has helped me in designing a foolproof user-experience.
  Leaving Indonesia at the young age of 12 to China, and migrating to United States at the age of 16 with my brother,
  has helped me conduct observations through different perspectives, which helped me to implement application in user-centric manner.
  My goal is to build application that not only scalable and efficient, but also providing an adaptable user-experiences.

  <strong> When I'm not coding and designing</strong>, I'm probably traveling, read books, and
   cook various unique and interesting dishes.
