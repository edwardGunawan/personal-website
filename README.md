# Personal Website v2

Hello! Thanks for checking out this repo for my latest portfolio website. This website is not just my new portfolio, but also personal website and about me.

## What I used
- [Atom](https://atom.io/) - editor
- [SweetScroll](https://tsuyoshiwada.github.io/sweet-scroll/) - for scrolling down pages
- [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) - static Site generator
- [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) - easy push to deploy hosting
-  [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) - more modular css
-  [Scroll Reveal](https://scrollrevealjs.org/) - easy scroll animation
- [Site map generator](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/)


Let me know what you think!
